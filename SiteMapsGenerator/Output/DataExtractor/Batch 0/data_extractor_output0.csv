""Delivering high value projects for our range of clients using the best people, tech and processes available, taking risk away from your organisation.""


Roger Gibbon | Partner




Despite over 16 years of experience of working with mobile services, I have learnt quite a lot myself from working together with this outstanding team and will truly miss them when the work package ends.


James Simcock | BBC




I have viewed and winced at the complexity of the project from a distance. The result is excellent and you should all be pleased and proud of the outcome. It is a great step forward and much more impressive as the showcase the Academy has hoped for. Thanks you all for sticking with it and making it work so well.

Welcome to the smart workspace

                These days, everything is smart—your phone, your credit card, your car, maybe even your house. But at work… not so much. Work is a mess, with documents and conversations spread across different platforms that don’t connect. It’s not your fault—technology at work just hasn’t caught up. It’s time for work to get smart. That’s why Dropbox is building the smart workspace.
            











Why now?











Think about how much work has changed in the last decade.

We’ve gone from a few software tools to dozens of popular apps, communication channels and project management systems, each multi-device and always-on. We have more technology, more intelligence, more people to work with in more ways than ever. But there’s a catch: the mental cost of managing it all. 

Most of us switch between apps at work every six minutes, with constant notifications interrupting our focus. With our content, tools, and teams all scattered, it’s no wonder we feel frustrated and teams can’t get in sync. As it gets harder to get important things done at work, we’re working more during off-hours to try to keep up. But even as we creep toward a 24-hour workday, global productivity is stalling.



We’re not working smart. It’s time for a change.












A new way to work











So, what is a smart workspace? And what does it look like? 

A smart workspace is a digital environment that brings all of a team’s content together with the tools they love. It helps users cut through the clutter and surfaces the work that matters most.
First, it connects all the content and tools you use for work, so everything is easily accessible. No more switching between platforms, apps, and content types—a smart workspace lets you use them in one place. 
 
Second, it brings together the people and conversation associated with a file or project. The context for your work is all here, instead of scattered across fragmented communication channels. 
 
Third, it uses machine intelligence to cut through the clutter and surface what matters most: It suggests which content you’ll need for a meeting or which might be relevant to a document you’re editing, and even recognizes images so you don’t have to remember file names.



A smart workspace limits the noise and complexity so you can focus on the work that matters. 







Sound good? We think so. A new way of working starts today.

“I wish I knew about this earlier! It would have been helpful to have this resource right when I started community college.”


Diablo Valley College
          Brianna N.
        








“EdVisorly really made me feel more comfortable with moving from Mexico to the US and starting college at a school I’ve never even visited; it really did make everything feel more achievable. EdVisorly gave me the confidence that I can transfer in 2 years.”


Santa Monica Community College
          Rafael M.
        








“There hasn’t been anything like this for community college students; I’m very appreciative. You guys are spot on.”


Santa Barbara City College
